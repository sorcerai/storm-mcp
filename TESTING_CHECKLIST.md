# STORM MCP System Testing Checklist

## Pre-deployment Testing

### ✅ Security Testing
- [ ] Validate input sanitization for all MCP tool arguments
- [ ] Test rate limiting mechanisms under load
- [ ] Verify session management limits are enforced
- [ ] Check error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Confirm no hardcoded API keys in codebase
- [ ] Test secure server configuration (server_secure.js)

### ✅ LLM Adapter Testing
- [ ] Claude adapter returns functional responses
- [ ] Gemini adapter simulates MCP tool usage correctly
- [ ] Kimi adapter requires API key and fails gracefully without it
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work when adapters are unavailable
- [ ] All adapter methods (generateText, generateWithMessages, etc.) function

### ✅ Swarm Orchestration Testing
- [ ] SwarmOrchestrator initializes without errors
- [ ] LLMDispatcher routes tasks to appropriate adapters
- [ ] Task execution completes successfully
- [ ] Agent specializations are properly configured
- [ ] Premium technical analysis detection works

### ✅ Integration Testing
- [ ] NPM dependencies install successfully
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] No circular dependencies detected
- [ ] Module system (ESM) works properly

## Performance Testing

### ✅ Load Testing
- [ ] System handles multiple concurrent requests
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Response times are acceptable (<2s for standard tasks)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents system overload

### ✅ Scalability Testing
- [ ] Swarm can scale to maximum agent count
- [ ] Task distribution is balanced across agents
- [ ] System degrades gracefully under high load

## Functional Testing

### ✅ STORM Workflow Testing
- [ ] Research phase generates comprehensive perspectives
- [ ] Outline generation creates structured content
- [ ] Article writing produces quality sections
- [ ] Polishing improves content quality
- [ ] End-to-end workflow completes successfully

### ✅ API Configuration Testing
- [ ] System works with all API keys configured
- [ ] System works with only Claude/Gemini (no Kimi)
- [ ] Environment variable loading works correctly
- [ ] Error handling for missing configurations

## Quality Assurance

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] All promise rejections are handled
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Code follows established patterns

### ✅ Documentation Testing
- [ ] README.md instructions are accurate
- [ ] SECURITY.md reflects actual implementation
- [ ] ENV_SETUP.md provides complete configuration guide
- [ ] All code comments are up-to-date

## Test Commands

### Basic System Test
```bash
npm test  # Run basic functionality tests
```

### Security Test
```bash
node -e "
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
console.log('Testing security configuration...');
// Add security-specific tests here
"
```

### Performance Test
```bash
node -e "
import { SwarmOrchestrator } from './swarm/orchestrator.js';
console.time('orchestrator-init');
const orchestrator = new SwarmOrchestrator();
console.timeEnd('orchestrator-init');
"
```

### Load Test
```bash
node -e "
import { LLMDispatcher } from './swarm/llm_dispatcher.js';
const dispatcher = new LLMDispatcher();
const tasks = Array(10).fill().map((_, i) => ({
  type: 'generate_perspective',
  perspective: 'Test',
  topic: \`Topic \${i}\`,
  assignedTo: \`agent-\${i}\`
}));
Promise.all(tasks.map(task => dispatcher.executeTask(task, {id: task.assignedTo, llm: 'claude'})))
  .then(() => console.log('✓ Load test passed'))
  .catch(err => console.log('✗ Load test failed:', err.message));
"
```

## Deployment Readiness

### ✅ Production Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Monitoring systems in place
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] API rate limits configured appropriately

### ✅ Rollback Plan
- [ ] Previous version backed up
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Database migrations are reversible
- [ ] Configuration changes are tracked

## Post-deployment Testing

### ✅ Smoke Tests
- [ ] System starts without errors
- [ ] Basic functionality works
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

### ✅ Monitoring Verification
- [ ] Error rates are within acceptable limits
- [ ] Response times meet SLA requirements
- [ ] API usage is tracking correctly
- [ ] System resources are not over-utilized

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find package 'uuid'"
**Solution**: Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Issue: "KIMI_API_KEY environment variable is required"
**Solution**: Set the environment variable or let system fallback to Claude/Gemini

### Issue: High memory usage
**Solution**: Reduce concurrent agent count or implement request queuing

### Issue: Slow response times
**Solution**: Use faster models (Claude/Gemini) for non-technical tasks
