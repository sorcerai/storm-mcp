## Archive

The `archive/` directory contains historical documentation files that were created during the development process but are no longer needed for normal operation:

- Development findings and empirical results
- Model verification and assignment documentation
- Configuration iterations and experiments
- Performance testing results

These files are preserved for reference but are not required for using the STORM MCP server.
