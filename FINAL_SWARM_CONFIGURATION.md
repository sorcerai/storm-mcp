# Final STORM MCP Swarm Configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Rethink: FREE Claude Sonnet 4 Changes Everything

### Models in Use:
1. **Claude Sonnet 4** - FREE in Claude Code (Hybrid reasoning model)
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Advanced features with 1M context
3. **Kimi K2** - Mathematical specialist ($0.15/$2.50 per 1M)

## ðŸ“Š New Agent Distribution (Quality-First)

```
Claude:  6 agents (60%) - MAXIMIZE FREE PREMIUM QUALITY
Gemini:  2 agents (20%) - For massive context & special features
Kimi:    2 agents (20%) - Only for specialized math/coding
```

## ðŸš€ Key Strategy Shift

### OLD Thinking (Cost-Optimized):
- Used Kimi extensively because it was 100x cheaper
- Reserved Claude for only the most important tasks
- Optimized for minimal API costs

### NEW Reality (Quality-Optimized):
- Claude Sonnet 4 is FREE - use it EVERYWHERE
- Only use other models for their unique capabilities
- Optimize for maximum quality, not cost

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Assignments

### Default to Claude Sonnet 4 for:
- ALL perspective generation
- ALL fact gathering and research
- ALL outline creation and review
- ALL general writing tasks
- ALL polishing and refinement
- ALL coordination tasks

### Use Gemini 2.5 Pro ONLY for:
- Documents exceeding 200K tokens (Gemini has 1M)
- Complex reasoning requiring thinking mode (if available)
- Multimodal tasks (video/image analysis)

### Use Kimi K2 ONLY for:
- Mathematical proofs requiring 97.4% accuracy
- Complex algorithm implementation
- Code verification where precision is critical

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Highlights

### orchestrator.js:
- 6 Claude agents with diverse roles
- 2 Gemini agents for specialized tasks
- 2 Kimi agents for math/coding only

### llm_dispatcher.js:
- Routes 80%+ of tasks to Claude by default
- Special routing only for edge cases
- Dynamic model switching for Gemini features

## ðŸ”¥ Bottom Line

**When the premium model is FREE, use it for EVERYTHING!**

The only exceptions:
- Need >200K context? â†’ Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Need mathematical proof accuracy? â†’ Kimi K2
- Everything else? â†’ Claude Sonnet 4!

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

1. **Quality**: Maximum possible with Claude Sonnet 4 everywhere
2. **Cost**: Minimal (only Gemini/Kimi for specific needs)
3. **Performance**: Optimized for quality over speed
4. **Flexibility**: Can still leverage unique model strengths

This configuration maximizes the value of FREE Claude Sonnet 4 while maintaining access to specialized capabilities when truly needed.
